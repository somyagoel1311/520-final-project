Tool Comparison : Neptune AI vs WanDB AI

Model Integration:

1. Neptune 

Steps to Integrate your ML model to Neptune AI:

1. Run the script 'neptune_integration.py'.
2. It'll prompt you for an API token. This token can be accessed from your Neptune account. For the purpose of this project, we will provide this token

Steps to find your NEPTUNE API token:

1. There will be a user menu at the bottom left of your Neptune app. Expand it and click on "Get your API token." That will display your API token. Copy it to your clipboard, and enter it when promopted.

2. WanDB AI 

Steps to Initiate WandB logging to the ML model - 

1. On Running the wandb script, you will recieve a prompt for authorising with an API Token on https://wandb.ai/authorize. To run this smoothly we have provided the API token. 
2. It can also be found in The WandB API Token is found in the "User settings" Section. 


3. Evaluation

1. Evaluation metrics


2. Rating scale

We are using a 5 point quantitative scale to evaluate how well a tool works. For each of our mentioned evaluation criterias,
both the tools get a rating between 1 and 5. Following is the definition of each rating:

1 : Tool does not have this ability.
2 : Tool performs poorly in this evaluation criteria.
3 : Tool has a satisfactory performance for this evaluation criteria.
4 : Tool performs well for this criteria.
5 : Tool performs well for this criteria and also makes it easy to use this ability.
